<P>I have made two OpenType fonts (not finished yet) you may
<A href="fontsrelease.zip">download</A>.
I am releasing them under the GNU Public License.
The <A href="fontsource.zip">sources</A> are available as well.

<h2>Legendum</h2>

<P>Legendum is a typeface not unlike MS's Verdana.
 It has been made for optimal screen readibility. It is anti-aliased on Windows
 as well. It now contains all normal Latin characters as well as all Greek
 characters, plus punctuation. All are instructed.
I use this permanently on my desktop, and have found it extremely nice to look
at for longer stretches of time.
</P>
<P>
It has the OpenType features "kern" (kerning), "lnum" (lining numerals;
it's got old-style numerals by default), "mark"/"mkmk" (mark positioning).
It comes in two flavours: Legendum_legacy.otf has hundreds of precomposed
characters (such as &eacute;) while Legendum.otf does not, but OpenType-aware
OSes and/or applications may be able to produce them anyway.
The file for the latter is a lot smaller though.
Most of the Latin combined glyphs are there, and (I think) all of the
Greek ones (including polytonic Greek).
</P>

<h2>Garogier</h2>
     
<P>Garogier is a typeface not unlike Garamond (hence
the name).
It will have optical size through its instructions (i.e. at low sizes,
also when it is used on a high-resolution device such as a printer, the characters
are changed slightly to increase readablity). This is supported by Windows
98 and up (this includes 2000 and XP). Freetype does not support it (yet).
</P>

<P>
I have not supplied a hinted version for the moment though.
The font has kerning through the OpenType feature "kern", supports ligatures
("liga"), both lining and old-style figures ("lnum") and small caps ("smcp").
If you are used to looking at Greek letters: I'd like to have some feedback
on those before I go on to instruct them.

<h2>TestInstructions</h2>

<p>
<a href="TestInstructions.ttf">TestInstructions</a> is a font that provides a number of minimal testcases for
TrueType instructions.
You can test the behaviour of virtual machines with it.
This is what it looks like at 12 pts (16 pixels) on Windows 2000:
