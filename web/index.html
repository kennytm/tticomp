<P>Though you'll not find any tools here that actually change glyphs' outlines,
you may find some helper tools here. Mind: none of these works on OpenType
fonts with Postscript outlines; however, some may be changed easily to
enable this, I think. Please do email
<A href="mailto:R.C.van.Dalen@umail.leidenuniv.nl">me</A> if you've got any
plans in that direction: I may be able to help you on your way a bit.</P>
       
<P>All these I have made primarily for my own use, but they may be useful
for you as well.

<ul>
      <li><a href="truetypeviewer.html">TrueTypeViewer</a> enables you to 
view  TrueType fonts, and, specifically, to debug the <i>instructions</i> 
embedded  in the font. It has a "Features" button that will allows 
you to apply OpenType features to the string;</li>
      <li><a href="tticomp.html">TTIComp</a> compiles a .TTI file (with <i>T</i>rue<i>T</i>ype
      <i>I</i>nstructions in a format not unlike C code) and a TrueType font
  into an instructed TrueType font;</li>
      <li><a href="otcomp.html">OTComp</a> takes a feature file in a format 
 not unlike Adobe's and produces an OpenType font with advanced layout tables.</li>
<LI><A href="otlegacy.html">OTLegacy</A> takes an OpenType font and adds
Unicode precomposed characters to it by applying the OpenType features.</LI>     
</ul>
       
<P>The <A href="source.html">sources</A> for all these are also available.
These work on Visual C++ 6.0 and gcc, but should compile on any C++ compiler with
only  a few changes. If you have made some changes you think I ought to apply,
please email them to me. The versions of the programs posted now are
<A href="news.html">brand new</A> and have been totally revised</P>

<p>You might also want to take a look at the <a
 href="fonts.html">fonts</a> I made so far.  </p>
       
<h2>A word of warning</h2>
      
<p>Both the TrueTypeViewer and TTIComp use TrueType instructions, crucial 
parts&nbsp;of which are patented by Apple. One page explaining something 
about this is <a href="http://www.freetype.org/patents.html">the one about 
the patents on  the FreeType site</a> (by the way, I'm not using the FreeType 
instruction  engine in my code, but the same patent related problems apply 
to my own <i>Virtual  Machine</i>). Though I am not a lawyer, what I understand 
is that you are  not allowed to download or use those programs if you are 
in a country where  those patents are valid (e.g., the USA) unless you have
acquired a license from Apple.</p>
