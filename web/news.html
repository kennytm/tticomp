TrueTypeViewer now accepts unicodes after a backslash;
numerous bugfixes, the most important of which are the fixes to the TrueType
virtual machine, which hopefully exhibits the same behaviour
(which is often weird compared to the specs)
as the Microsoft virtual machine;
the internal representation of fixed point numbers has changed drastically.
</LI>

<LI><B>23 August 2003</B><BR>
Small bugfixes: gcc 3.3 warning about integer constants missing suffixes
has been addressed;
outline representation has changed slightly;
slight performance enhancements in reading/writing files.

Numerous fixes and enhancements; the most important being the addition
of support for contextual lookups in OTComp.
Furthermore, I've written an OTComp tutorial which basically should cover
everything and make you make your own OpenType Layout-enabled fonts
in no time.
Any comments and suggestions are welcome!
Finally, I've added a whole lot of new glyphs to Legendum and slightly
changed all the rest.

The new versions of the programs are finally up.
The OpenType font manipulation library (OTFont) uses some more advanced
features of C++ (STL, exceptions) that make it a better, cleaner and safer
library.
It may however be somewhat slower for relatively small files.
On the other hand, the binaries I post are now release versions so that
makes things quicker.
The programs have changed quite a lot, but I have only rewritten 
OTComp. The interfaces have not changed much.<BR>
I'm expecially keen on bugs in error handling from now on; if you run across
errors (in fonts or other input files) that are not handled as gracefully
as they should be, please let me know!
</LI>

<LI><B>2 February 2003</B><BR>
I have a totally new version of my OTFont library
(rewritten from scratch) I am porting all applications to.
The new framework is a lot cleaner, a lot less error-prone, has much better
checks for invalid inputs, and is probably a bit slower.
It will work on gcc 2.9 as well 
(it hasn't got <CODE>#pragma pack</CODE> anymore).
I will make all publicly available as soon as I have working versions of all
programs and improved versions of the fonts.
I hope this will be at the end of March.</LI>
