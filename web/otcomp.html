<p>The OTComp tool takes a font file and a file containing feature information
to produce an OpenType file.
You can download the <A href="otcomp.zip">binary</A> (i.e. a working program
file) for Windows.
You may also take a look at the <a href="source.html">source</a>.
It now implements almost all lookups.
A <A href="otcomp/introduction.html">tutorial</A> is available.

There are also other tools available that also produce OpenType layout tables.

<A href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/volt/default.htm">
Microsoft's <B>VOLT</B></A> is a tool that allows you to edit the tables
graphically, which makes things very easy to grasp.
However, I found that it is difficult to edit the font afterwards.
Also, VOLT does not support using contour points as mark anchors, which
makes hinting anchors impossible.

<A href="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/otfdk/index.jsp">
Adobe's <B>Font Developer Kit</B></A> contains an OpenType layout compiler as well.
This one works with an input file containing a textual description, just
like OTComp.
It is, however, much geared towards Type 1 fonts, and does not support mark
anchors contour points either.

<P>
Personally, I feel using text input for an OpenType layout compiler
is very important since it allows you to start with the same file for the
various different faces (regular, bold, italic) and to change only the parts
that are different for this face.
OTComp mirrors the OpenType file format pretty closely,
providing a powerful tool.
It fulfills my needs, of course, but if <I>you</I> need anything that is not yet
in there (device tables, cursive attachment, reverse chaining contextual
lookups), <A href="mailto:R.C.van.Dalen@umail.leidenuniv.nl">contact me</A>
and I will add it.

For examples please take a look at the <A href="fontsources.zip">sources</A> of my
