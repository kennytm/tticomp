<P>
The context and chaining context lookups are meta-lookups:
they specify a certain context, in which other lookups may operate at
different positions.
The sub-lookups may be either substitution or positioning lookups.
</P>

<P class="codeFragment">
<CODE>
lookup abcToxx {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;context (q) a b c (r);<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub 0 ab_to_x;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub 1 c_to_x;<BR>
}<BR>
<BR>
lookup ab_to_x {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub a b -> x;<BR>
}<BR>
<BR>
lookup c_to_x {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub c -> x;<BR>
}
</CODE>
</P>

<P>
This example shows a (nonsense) lookup that changes the sequence "qabcr" into
"qxxr".
It works as follows:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>
A context is found which matches the <CODE>context (q) a b c (r)</CODE> bit;
in this context, the sequence "abc" is the <I>input sequence</I>.
The "q" sequence is called the <I>backtrack sequence</I>.
The "r" sequence is called the <I>lookahead sequence</I>.
These may be longer than one glyph, and they may contain glyph lists.
</LI>
<LI>
The lookup "ab_to_x" is applied at position 0.
This yields the changed input sequence "xc".
</LI>
<LI>
The lookup "c_to_x" is applied at position 1.
This means the "c" is changed to "x".
</LI>
<LI>
The lookup continues its work starting immediately after the input sequence.
</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Replacing i by dotlessi before marks</H2>
<P>
That was a nice example showing how things work exactly,
but here is a more useful example.
When the glyph "i" is followed by a mark above,
the dot above the i is removed and the mark is placed over
the "dotlessi" glyph.
This may be done be replacing "i" by "dotlessi" whenever it is followed
by a mark above.
</P>

<P class="codeFragment">
<CODE>
lookup dotlessI {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignore mark except @marksAbove;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;context [i j] (@marksAbove);<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub 0 iToDotlessI;<BR>
}<BR>
<BR>
lookup iToDotlessI {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub i -> dotlessi;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub j -> dotlessj;<BR>
}
</CODE>
</P>

<P>
The context that is matched here is either i or j,
followed by a combining mark above.
If such a sequence is found, at position 0
(the first position of the input sequence)
a lookup is applied that changes "i" into "dotlessi" and "j" into "dotlessj".
</P>

<P>
<B>Note</B>: OTComp will generate a <I>contextual lookup</I> when you specify
no glyphs for the backtrack and lookahead sequences.
If you do, a <I>chaining contextual lookup</I> will be generated.
</P>

<P>
<B>Note 2</B>: this lookup may be too powerful for "normal" use;
if you think so and have a good idea for a simpler syntax that is easier to
use, please let me know.
