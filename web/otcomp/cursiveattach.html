<P>
The cursive attachment lookup may be used for scripts that require
glyphs to attach to the previous glyphs at exit and entry points.
However, since I don't know any script that needs this, I have not been
able to implement it.
If you need it and you may be able to explain to me how this works,
let me know and I'll add support for it.
