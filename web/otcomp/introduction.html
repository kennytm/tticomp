<P>
This tutorial is not meant to give you an in-depth introduction into
the OpenType layout tables, but rather to let you add sensible <I>features</I> to
your font files.
For more in-depth information about OpenType, I would like to
refer you to the OpenType specifications as available from the pages at <A 
href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec">Microsoft</A> or 
<A href="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/opentype/main.html">Adobe</A>.
However, if you think this information is not complete, unclear, or if you
have any other comments, questions or additions, please
<A href="mailto:R.C.van.Dalen@umail.leidenuniv.nl">mail me</A>.</p>

<P>
Note that I don't speak any languages that use a non-Latin script.
If you've got any questions, comments, suggestions, better examples or
whatever about another script type, please let me know as well.

<h2>Running the OpenType Compiler</h2>

<p>Running the OpenType Compiler is a matter of running <CODE>otcomp
&lt;<I>ot file name</I>&gt;</CODE>. The extension of the input file should be
specified, and is usually <CODE>.ot</CODE>.
But what does this file look like?
Let's first explain some OpenType terminology.
