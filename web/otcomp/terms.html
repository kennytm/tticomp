<P>
OpenType was meant to provide type designers with more control over how
their fonts behave.
This is especially important in languages that use a great deal of
diacritics and/or contextual replacement, such as Arabic or Indic languages.
For this, the OpenType layout tables were invented.
These are font file tables that include information about the substitution
and positioning of glyphs in certain circumstances.
</P>

<H2>Substitution</H2>
<P>
Glyph substitution in Latin is optional.
However, it is often used to provide esthetical alternatives.
The "fi" sequence is often rendered as a used ligature:
</P>
<P><IMG src="../image/fi.png"></P>

<P>
Another area where glyph substitution may come in useful is to provide
justification alternates: thus, the line may be aligned without having
to resort to wider or narrower spacing,
by substituting a wider glyph for "a".
</P>

<H2>Positioning</H2>
<P>
Glyphs may have be positioned for esthetic reasons, but often without
glyph positioning is plain wrong.
For example, this illustration of a sound change would not be clear at all:
</P>
<P><IMG src="../image/breakingfaulty.png"></P>
<P>
From this, however, it immediately becomes clear we are speaking about
one of the changes
in <I>Old English breaking</I> where short or long <I>e</I> becomes
a short or long diphthong <I>eo</I>:
</P>
<P><IMG src="../image/breakinggood.png"></P>
<P>
These examples show two things:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
glyph positioning may be important for understanding what things are supposed
to say;
</LI>
<LI>
in the Latin script the need for intelligent glyph positioning
is not that urgent, which makes clear why the
computer industry has taken such a long time to implement more difficult
glyph positioning.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
(If you have any examples in other languages that show the problems better,
please tell me!)
