<p>The TrueTypeViewer, TTIComp, OTComp and OTLegacy all use my
easy-to-handle, fast and safe OpenType font manipulation library.
You may download the <A href="fonttools-20030823.zip">
sources to all of those</A> at once.
The current version is 20030318.
Building the tools requires the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual C++ 6.0, which will build the applications straight away, and
for which project and workspace files are provided,
or gcc (version 3 works on cygwin and GNU/Linux;
version 2.95 with STLport should work but doesn't,
a volunteer to look into this?).
It should be possible to compile the sources on any other C++ compiler with
decent template and STL support.<BR>
I would appreciate being notified
of any changes that make the code more portable.
</li>

<li>The Qt library for the TrueTypeViewer.
I use version 2.3 for Windows.
Qt is an easy-to-use, cross-platform, object-oriented library downloadable
from <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/">www.trolltech.com</a>.
Note again that the Qt library is only required for the TrueTypeViewer,
as this is an application with a GUI.
The other ones are console applications.
Never mind the "Qt" project Visual C++ can't find when you open the
TrueTypeViewer workspace;
this does not matter at all.
</li>

<li>The relative paths should be as in the ZIP file.
All applications refer
to the OTFont library with <code>#include "../OTFont/OpenTypeFile.h"</code>
so that has to work.
</li>
</ul>

<P>
All of the programs are distributed under the GNU General Public License,
which allows you do to pretty much with it (like selling them, if you can
find anyone who is crazy enough to pay for them, or changing the source and
redistributing them).
However, I would like to incorporate any improvements in the versions
you find here.
So if you find any bugs, or have suggestions for improvements, don't hesitate
to email <a href="mailto:R.C.van.Dalen@umail.leidenuniv.nl">me</a>.
If you've
got a bug you cannot find a solution for, please email me instructions on
how to reproduce the bug and I'll try to do what I can. Thank you.
