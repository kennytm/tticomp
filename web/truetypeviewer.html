<p>The TrueTypeViewer shows any TrueType font. It is extremely useful for debugging
TrueType instructions and for viewing OpenType Layout features.
Its user interface should be self-explanatory. 
Any questions remaining, however, should be directed to <a
href="mailto:R.C.van.Dalen@umail.leidenuniv.nl">me</a>.
</p>

<p>
The virtual machine should now do exactly the same as the one provided by
Microsoft in Windows 2000.
This includes all undocumented behaviour for twilight points.
If you find anything still looking wrong, please
<a href="mailto:R.C.van.Dalen@umail.leidenuniv.nl">
send me a note</a>.
</p>

<P>
It now supports all OpenType positioning and substitution lookups.
To see these working, you may try <I>Palatino Linotype</I> that comes with
Windows, or one of my own <A href="fonts.html">fonts</A>.
</P>
   
<h2>A screenshot</h2>

 such as IE 5)</SPAN>
 </P>
   
<h2>Download</h2>
   
<p>You may download a <a
href="truetypeviewer.zip">MS Windows binary</A> (i.e., a working program file) here.
It works on Windows 2000 and Windows
95; other 32 bit Windowses (98, ME, XP etc.) should work as well. You do
need the <i>Qt library</i> though. If you do not yet have the file <b>qt-mt230nc.dll</b>
on your system, you can download a <a href="truetypeviewerqt.zip">version of
the TrueTypeViewer that includes
the file</a>.</p>
   
<p>The <a href="source.html">source</a> is available as well. If you find
 any bug, please email <a
 href="mailto:R.C.van.Dalen@umail.leidenuniv.nl">me</a>  (please make sure
I'll be able to reproduce it using the information you give me). Thank you.</p>
