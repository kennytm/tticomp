<H2>Running TTIComp</H2>

<P>
You may want to know how to actually run TTIComp.
Make sure you are in the
right directory. Then type <CODE>tticomp -o <I>&lt;tti file name&gt;</I></CODE>.
The following options may be used.
</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>-o</CODE> produces <U>o</U>ptimised code. Because optimisation in the case
of TrueType instructions means mostly gathering stack pushes and reducing
unnecessary zone pointer setting, the resulting code actually is a lot easier
to follow in a program such as TrueTypeViewer. I recommend you use this switch
unless you have good reasons not to.
Oh, by the way, the switch will reduce the size of the instructions with a
factor of 5 or so.
</LI>

<LI><CODE>-l</CODE> produces a program <U>l</U>isting. This may be useful to
see where the compiler didn't understand you or where you didn't get the
compiler.
It will also print the list of predefined functions, which may be useful as
well.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Of course, the switches may help you find bugs in the TTIComp program.
If you do, please send <A href="mailto:R.C.van.Dalen@umail.leidenuniv.nl">me</A> a
note.
Please include the .tti file that gave the problem, plus the font file, if
necessary.
But please don't send me files that are larger than 100kB. Thanks.
