<P>As you have probably arrived at this page because you want to know about TrueType
instructions and how to edit them, an extremely short introduction into
<I>hinting</I> is given here. If you want to read more, or if you do not yet
know what <A class="tooltipLink" href="?"
onclick="showTooltip(event,glyphTip); return false">
glyphs</A> or <I>contour points</I> are, you may want to find your way to
more general information available on the web before diving into this.
</P>

<P>The history of font file formats is long, but the relevant bit starts with
<I>Type 1</I> fonts. The Type 1 font file format was invented by Adobe and is
used in the Postscript printer language and in PDF (Portable Document Format)
files. It is an outline format, that is, the glyphs are specified by their
outlines (by cubic splines). TrueType is another outline format, that uses
conic splines. Though cubic splines form a superset of conic splines, they
can be converted to conic splines, in which case sometimes a number of extra
points are needed to represent the original splines. The distortion this
results in is usually minimal because of the high resolution used to specify
the outline points. On the other hand, conic splines are mathematically less
complex, so that they can in principle be rendered more quickly.
</P>
       
<H2>What are TrueType instructions?</H2>
<P>That's a difficult question you just asked! One major problem in
using outline font files on low-resolution devices such as computer screens is
what was described by ... as <A href="asdlfj">The Raster Tragedy at Low
Resolution</A>. Basically, outlines may fall off pixels or turn on more than
one pixel row at random, because they are scaled down to a given number of
pixels. In Type 1 fonts, it is tried to solve this by using <A class="tooltipLink" href="?"
onclick="showTooltip(event,pfaeditTip); return false">hints</A>.</P>

<H3>Hints</H3>
<P>Hints are things that tell the rasteriser (the program that renders a string
of characters to a surface) something about the topology of the character. For
example, they may identify the two horizontal stems and the vertical one of the
character "H". More advanced descriptions are available as well. The hints are
normally added by the font designer or another human being, though the computer
may be able do some things automatically.</P>
<P>It should be clear that the rasteriser has to use these hints to display
glyphs well. This is not at all a trivial task. Usually the glyph is stretched
so that the stems fit the pixels in some way. Italic characters or slanted
stems are extremely difficult to get right. Whatever smart algorithms are used,
some glyphs will always look slightly less than perfect.
</P>

<H3>Instructions</H3><P>The way to make sure small glyph bitmaps look perfect is, obviously, create
them by hand. The <A class="tooltipLink" href="?"
onclick="currentInstructionImage=1; showTooltip(event,instructionsTip, true); return false">instructions</A> that
<I>TrueType</I> uses can do this, though
it may take a lot of work (most of which must be done by humans). TrueType
instructions allow the designer to include programs with every glyph to
distort the outline in any way the designer wants it to. This should not be
called hinting, as it has more to do with commanding than with hinting, but it
is often called hinting anyway. So, when it says
"TrueType hinting", it means "TrueType instructing". The instructions are
executed by a <A href="?" class="tooltipLink"
onclick="showTooltip(event,virtualMachineTip); return false">Virtual Machine</A>.
</P>

<P>The instructions have many
advantages: everything you want to do can be done. You may, for example, want
to remove all stems at lower sizes, or to delete other features not necessary
to convey what character the glyph represents. It also means that hinting done
in <I>any</I> other hinting system may be converted to TrueType instructions,
though this does not necessarily lead to good-looking fonts compared to
manually instructed ones.
</P>

<H3>Producing TrueType Instructions</H3>
<P>The abundance of not-terribly-well hinted fonts available from everywhere
makes painfully clear that hand-hinting is a difficult job for which it is
difficult to produce tools. Microsoft has its <I>Visual TrueType</I> tool which
is said to work pretty well. FontLab has got a rather limited set of
instructions which do allow access to the instruction set in a visual way.
</P>

<H2>The TrueType Instruction Compiler</H2>
<P>Knowing that TrueType fonts basically contain small programs, however, I
was amazed to find how few tools for actually programming TrueType
instructions were available (zero, to my knowledge). This was why I made my own tool.
Its input consists of a programming language which may be characterised as a
simplified version of C. The fact that programming skills are required may
immediately be seen as evidence that it is not as <I>easy</I> to use the
TrueType Instruction Compiler, as I called it in an extremely creative mood,
as it is to use more visual tools. However, it is more powerful and as I did not
add many difficult constructions or anything a basic knowledge of any
procedural or object-oriented programming language will do.
